# PartsDatabase
List of resources for keeping track of components used in designs

* I built a part numbering and tracking system when I was young and nieve. It handled 3D models, datasheets, cheat notes, handled BOMs and schematics for released projects, and autogenerated part numbers. This project was done with endless confidence that inexperience brings. There are many similar projects out there but seems to be a lack of a standard system. I would like to put together a set of composable tools based on a git repo for underlying files and an SQLLite database just like with a django project.
* There should be a few defined APIs allowing for different sections to join together
  - Part data entry: This would enter a part into an internal database. Additional data could be pulled from supplier data bases including 3D models, footprints, and datasheets. Basic data should be automatic.
  - Part numbering: A scheme for refering to parts in the database by an internal part number designation. These need to be unique and unchanging. It would be useful for this to be seperate from the rest of the system, allowing for different mapping if required. A list of internal or distributer part numbers could be compared using a CSV or similar
  - Design Revision Tracker: A scheme for releasing design documents and keeping them associated. Coupling here is loose and just needs a way to regenerate partnumbers and update and design information if errors are found.
  - Project Part Search: Search for all the projects and revisions a part was used.
